## Build (using CMake and vcpkg)

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```powershell
    git clone [https://github.com/NoaSecond/Plume-Engine.git](https://github.com/NoaSecond/Plume-Engine.git)
    cd Plume-Engine
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies with vcpkg:**
    ```powershell
    vcpkg install sdl2 glad glm ufbx
    ```
3.  **Configure and build with CMake:**
    ```powershell
